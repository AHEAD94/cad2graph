# cad2graph  
This repository provides a Python-based solution for converting data extracted from architectural CAD drawings into a graph data structure. It enables the representation of building structures as interconnected nodes and edges for analysis, visualization, or further computational processing.  

While the implementation does not yet cover all drawing cases comprehensively, It provides a solid foundation for further research and can be extended to handle a wider range of architectural data.

### Features
- Converts architectural CAD data into a graph-based structure.
- Supports representation of building structures with interconnected nodes and edges.
- Enables further analysis, visualization, and computational workflows.

### Future Work
- Expanding support for additional drawing cases.
- Enhancing the accuracy and flexibility of the conversion process.
